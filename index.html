            <p>
                Looking back, this was a transition year that has been full of movement.
                I quit my job, and created a new routine for myself.
            </p>

                <li><strong>Home & Groundedness</strong> — creating a home that feels like home, and finding groups and

                <li><strong>Rhythm</strong> — building a stable daily rhythm that supports energy and focus over the
                    long run</li>
                <li><strong>Entrepreneurial</strong> — starting a small side business and learning through real
                    experience</li>
                <li><strong>Contributing</strong> — this can be reviews, mentoring, teaching, or open source work</li>
                <li><strong>Learning & Teaching</strong> — growing by doing, and sharing that growth through teaching

                    Exploring different jobs, sports, and creative efforts.

            <!-- Thoughts on AI -->
            <!-- <section class="container section">
            <h2>Thoughts on AI</h2>
            <p>
                I use AI almost every day — sometimes as a tool, sometimes as a conversation partner.
                It helps me write, learn faster, and think more clearly. But it’s also teaching me something deeper:
                how much of creativity is pattern, and how much is feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see AI as a way to extend what humans already do — not to replace it.
                It’s great for structure, translation, summarizing ideas, learning new concepts,
                generating first drafts, and making sense of complex topics.
                It can help with planning, coding, design, language learning, and reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, it can’t feel, care, or take responsibility. That’s on us.
                The most interesting use of AI right now, I think, is when it helps people connect better —
                with themselves, with each other, and with what they actually want to build.
