            <p>
                Looking back, this was a transition year that has been full of movement.
                I quit my job, and created a new routine for myself.

            <p>
                I grew up in the Netherlands, mostly between Groningen and Amsterdam. School taught me how to think;
                life is teaching me how to feel. Somewhere between computers, people, and the outdoors, I’m finding
                my rhythm again.

            <h2>Teaching — across subjects</h2>
            <p>
                I’m curious about becoming a teacher in more than one subject. It feels natural: knowledge overlaps,
                and real learning happens at the edges where fields meet. In the Netherlands we tend to certify per
                subject,
                which is clear and safe, but it can also make school feel siloed. I’m exploring what a broader,
                more integrated teaching role could look like — connecting math, computer science, movement, and
                practical skills.

            <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t know what next year will look like — and I like that.
                2025 was about movement, learning and remembering what matters.
                Here’s to whatever comes next.

        <!-- Thoughts on AI -->
        <section class="container section">
            <h2>Thoughts on AI</h2>
            <p>
                I use AI almost every day — sometimes as a tool, sometimes as a conversation partner.
                It helps me write, learn faster, and think more clearly. But it’s also teaching me something deeper:
                how much of creativity is pattern, and how much is feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see AI as a way to extend what humans already do — not to replace it.
                It’s great for structure, translation, summarizing ideas, learning new concepts,
                generating first drafts, and making sense of complex topics.
                It can help with planning, coding, design, language learning, and reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, it can’t feel, care, or take responsibility. That’s on us.
                The most interesting use of AI right now, I think, is when it helps people connect better —
                with themselves, with each other, and with what they actually want to build.
